## Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion Powered

An [Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion (OTEC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean_thermal_energy_conversion) system has unique benefits (with 24/7/365 renewable base-load power and integrated seawater cooling) as a utility provider for an innovative data center facility.  Furthermore, integrating data center facility cooling and onsite energy recovery for the high temperature reservoir side of the OTEC power cycle has a unique efficiency-boosting value for the system.
