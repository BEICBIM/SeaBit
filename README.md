# SeaBit
This is an exploratory committee repository for a project based learning experience to develop a purpose-built, sustainable, maritime data center facility project that integrates innovative ocean renewable power, cooling, & telecommunication sub-systems.

The carrying capacity of seafloor fiber optic cable (with respect to satellites) and the electromagnetic protection and other security benefits of offshore facility designs that integrate power generation and data center facility design beneath the free surface (e.g. [MS Project Natick](http://natick.research.microsoft.com/)) has unique convenience and value to intensive processing & communicating significant amounts of data.  Compared to losses transmittig power to shore, there is load proximity benefit to integrate a data center facility with [marine energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_energy) renewable power generation and submarine fiber optic infrastructure (e.g. [seafloor cables](http://submarine-cable-map-2016.telegeography.com/)).  Connection may be accomplished by splicing operations similar to [submarine cable repair splicing opertaions](https://youtu.be/m6qTk5WNq9E).
