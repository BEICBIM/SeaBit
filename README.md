# SeaBit
This is a open source repository for a project based learning experience in planning and development of purpose-built, sustainable, maritime data center facility projects that integrate innovative ocean renewable power, cooling, & telecommunication sub-systems.

## Rationale:
This planning and project development respository assesses how [marine renewable energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_energy) power project or offshore wind power alternatives might pay for themselves faster if there was a significant customer load (like an underwater Bitcoin mining data center) in close proximity, rather than transmitting power ashore.  The carrying capacity of seafloor telecom cables (with respect to satellites) and offshore facility designs that integrate power generation with underwater data center facilities (e.g. [MS Project Natick](http://natick.research.microsoft.com/)) has potentially unique benefits in proximity, electromagnetic & physical security, and cooling-load value for intensive data processing operations.  Connection may be accomplished by [submarine cable repair splicing operations](https://youtu.be/m6qTk5WNq9E).
